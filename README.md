𝐋𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥 2: 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤 3 - Feature Engineering
 # Task: 
 
 📌 Extract additional features from existing columns, such as restaurant name length or address length.
 
 📌 Create new features like "Has Table Booking" and "Has Online Delivery" by encoding categorical variables.

# 💡𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈 𝐝𝐢𝐝:

 ✅ Created new features like restaurant name length and address length for deeper insights.
 
 ✅ Encoded categorical variables to binary features (1 for Yes, 0 for No).
 
 ✅ Analyzed feature correlations to understand relationships between variables.

# 🔧 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐜𝐤 𝐔𝐬𝐞𝐝:

 ✔ Python 🐍
 
 ✔ Pandas for feature extraction
 
 ✔ Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
 
 ✔ Google Colab for execution

# 🔍 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 & 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬:

 📌 Some restaurants have longer names or addresses, which may indicate branding strategies.
 
 📌 The presence of table booking and online delivery varies across different locations.
 
 📌 Feature engineering plays a crucial role in improving data quality for machine learning models.

# 💡 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐈 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐝:

 ✅ How newly derived features can provide valuable insights.
 
 ✅ The importance of encoding categorical data for better model performance.
 
 ✅ Feature correlation can help in selecting the most important variables for analysis.
